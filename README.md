## Exercises

1. Implement `DrawLineDDA`. Prove it works by attaching screenshots.
2. (optional) Implement a program that rotates a vector. The zero point must be in the middle of the window. You must not use any built-in rotation functionality. Just animate an angle and recompute point position using cos/sin functions.
